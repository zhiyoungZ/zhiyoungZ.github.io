Here are some selected research projects I have worked on during my undergraduate studies.

## Urban Functional Zone Classification Driven by Vision-Language Models
*Core Member | National Second Prize in Paper Competition*

<div style="text-align: justify">
This project aimed to improve classification accuracy in complex urban areas. 
<ul>
  <li>Proposed a multimodal method fusing <b>POI data</b> and <b>Remote Sensing images</b>.</li>
  <li>Utilized <b>Large Language Models (LLMs)</b> for POI filtering (reducing noise by 80%) and category prediction.</li>
  <li>Achieved F1 score improvements of 0.43% (Residential), 1.49% (Commercial), and 2.85% (Institutional) in the Beijing 2nd Ring Road validation area.</li>
</ul>

## Authenticity Identification of TCM Decoction Pieces Based on Hyperspectral Imaging
*Core Member*

<div style="text-align: justify">
<ul>
  <li>Applied <b>Hyperspectral Imaging</b> to distinguish authentic sour jujube seeds from fake ones.</li>
  <li>Conducted data preprocessing (dark current correction, spectral calibration) and utilized <b>ENVI</b> for supervised classification.</li>
  <li>Identified the absolute and relative maximum difference wavebands for quantitative identification.</li>
</ul>

## Water Quality Inversion of Dianchi Lake Based on Sentinel-2 & BP Neural Network
*Core Member*

<div style="text-align: justify">
<ul>
  <li>Built a <b>BP Neural Network</b> model to invert Total Nitrogen concentration using <b>Sentinel-2</b> satellite imagery.</li>
  <li>Selected features by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients using <b>Python</b>.</li>
  <li>Achieved an R² of <b>0.95</b>, significantly outperforming the traditional multivariate linear regression model (0.78).</li>
</ul>
